                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
                    <p class="py-6">DOM means Document Object Model and it refers to a programming interface for web
                        documents. DOM is
                        used to make dynamic changes or updates on websites. The DOM represents the web page as a
                        hierarchical tree of nodes and objects, they can be manipulated and traversed using programming
                        languages such as JavaScript. By using DOM web developers can easily change, update and
                        manipulate
                        the website to make it more interactive with users.</p>

        <div class="hero my-6 md:w-[80%] mx-auto rounded-lg bg-base-200">
            <div class="hero-content flex-col lg:flex-row">
                <img src="images/elements.png" class="md:max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow-2xl" />

                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
                    </h1>
                    <p class="py-6">To select HTML elements using the DOM, we can use getElementById() and
                        querySelector(). getElementById() allows us to select an element by its id attribute, while
                        querySelector() allows us to select elements based on their tag name, class name, or any other
                        valid CSS selector. We can also use methods such as getElementsByTagName(),
                        getElementsByClassName() or querySelectorAll().</p>

        <div class="hero my-6 md:w-[80%] mx-auto rounded-lg bg-base-200">
            <div class="hero-content flex-col lg:flex-row">

                <div>
                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is event bubble?</h1>
                    <p class="py-6">In web development, event bubbling is also known as "event propagation". When an
                        event occurs on a
                        specific element, such as a mouse click or a keyboard input, the event is first handled by that
                        element. Then, the event is propagated or "bubbled" up to the element's parent, and then to its
                        parent's parent, and so on, until the event reaches the top of the hierarchy, which is typically
                        the
                        document object.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
                    <p class="py-6">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.
                        This process is
                        used so that the callback function can be called by the other function at a later time or in
                        response to some event or condition.</p>
